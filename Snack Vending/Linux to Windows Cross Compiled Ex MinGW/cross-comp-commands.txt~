To create Windows executables, you need to install mingw cross-compiler:

sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
Then you can create 32-bit Windows executable with:

i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o main32.exe main.c
And 64-bit Windows executable with:

x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -o main64.exe main.c
Note that these Windows executables will not work inside Linux Subsystem, only outside of it.
